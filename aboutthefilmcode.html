<h3>About the Film</h3>[one_third]<h5>For over a decade, <strong>Len and Georgia Morris</strong> have been making films about children in extreme poverty and advocating for change.</h5>
<blockquote>“We have seen many good programs that work on a small scale, but the need is too great. Passing the global hat to feed, educate and protect all children will never work. What’s required is a global business plan from the source. . . and <strong>THE SAME HEART.</strong></blockquote>[/one_third][two_third_last]<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/o3Whyeg5fz4?autoplay=1&rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>[/two_third_last][three_col][caption_image url="/gfx/l&amp;g.jpg" width="420" height="275"]Len &amp; Georgia Morris[/caption_image][/three_col][three_col]<strong>THE SAME HEART</strong> follows a growing number of global economists, joining their voices with moral leaders of the world. They agree that an extremely small financial transaction tax, <strong>“The Robin Hood Tax,”</strong> could for the first time, place the needs of children at the heart of the global financial system.
<p style="text-align: left;">Suggesting a sustainable approach, <strong>THE SAME HEART</strong> also follows a dynamic Kenyan community organizer who devotes his life to making programs work from the bottom up. He is our man in the trenches.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In Geoffrey’s words ...</p>

<blockquote>It’s an approach for lasting change if we all come at it, from First World to Third with the same heart.</blockquote>

<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
[three_col]
[caption_image url="/gfx/len.jpg" width="420" height="275"]Len Morris[/caption_image]
Recently, out of curiosity I Googled, <strong>“The Same Heart.”</strong> The search engine sent me to the Old Testament Book of Jeremiah where the phrase was defined as
<blockquote>“Sharing the same path, purpose and unity of action. Having the same spirit.”</blockquote>
I’ve often heard the phrase spoken by a young community organizer we’ve worked with, <strong>Geoffrey Bakhuya</strong>. Raised in rural poverty, Geoffrey has seen first-hand the efforts by governments and NGO’s to help Kenyans help themselves. To Geoffrey, the same heart has little to do with money.
[/three_col][three_col]
<blockquote>“We should be our brother’s keeper, everyone from Kenya and beyond should have the same heart to fight poverty the same heart to help children who are in need of care and protection. So when you come together, the common enemy is poverty. It’s like rainwater, it collects in small streams until it becomes like a big river. There’s power in numbers.”</blockquote>
This is a film about children and poverty. We began <strong>THE SAME HEART</strong> five years ago as an attempt to make sense of what we’ve seen and experienced making our previous films on child labor and street children.
In 1990, the global community came together in an extraordinary moment to set eight <strong>Millennium Development Goals</strong>: to end poverty, hunger, fight disease, protect the earth, promote gender equality and create a more equitable planet. Pledges of funding were made, programs initiated, and funds spent to achieve the goals by 2015.

There has been real progress. Poverty has been cut in half, mostly as a result of economic growth in Asia, polio has all but been eradicated, malaria and TB reduced. Deaths from HIV have declined, child mortality is down and millions of children have gone to school for the first time. The world has seen what’s possible.
[/three_col][three_col_last]
Yet extreme poverty still leaves nearly <strong>a billion people hungry and living on less than a dollar a day</strong>, forcing <strong>215 million children into child labor</strong> and allowing <strong>nine million children to die each year</strong> from preventable causes.

When triumphant headlines read “456,000 children receive HIV/AIDS drugs” the next headline should have been “But 3.5 million kids are infected.” The drugs exist but the funding isn’t there and so children still die. Knowing what we know, we all share in the responsibility for these deaths.

<strong>THE SAME HEART</strong> is a film that tackles what it will take to actually end this kind of extreme poverty that our world’s children are inheriting. What are the alternatives to our complicated and voluntary aid system where most countries, our own included, deliver less than half the funds we have pledged? What do we need to do differently? We have asked these questions of Nobel Laureates, economists, politicians, activists, child laborers and community organizers.

Economists and moral leaders know it’s possible to feed and educate every child, provide medicine to the sick, shelter, clean air and water. We can have this world if we want it badly enough. It will take money of course, time, innovation and political will.
What it will take is <strong>THE SAME HEART.</strong>[/three_col_last][/tab_pane]

Over the past fifteen years, we have been producing a trilogy of films that focus on the causes and best practice solutions to child labor, children on the streets and chronic poverty.

<h4>Stolen Childhoods</h4>
Narrated by Meryl Streep and filmed in eight countries, broadcast worldwide and translated into six languages, <a href="http://galenfilms.com/?page_id=87" target="_blank"><strong>STOLEN CHILDHOODS</strong></a> is the story of 215 million children for whom life is nothing but work.
The film places these children’s stories in the broader context of the worldwide struggle against child labor. <strong>Stolen Childhoods</strong> provides an understanding of the causes of child labor, what it costs the global community, how it contributes to global insecurity and what it will take to eliminate it.

<h4>Rescuing Emmanuel</h4>
A thirteen-year-old boy named Emmanuel living on the streets of Nairobi buttonholes the filmmakers and will not be denied. What was going to be a film about the global problem of 100 million children abandoned to raise themselves on the streets of the world turns into the story of this boy. Shot over five years in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Kenya and the United States, <a href="http://galenfilms.com/?page_id=87"><strong><strong>Rescuing Emmanuel</strong></strong></a> is a window into a growing global human rights crisis, its multiple causes and the dreams of one boy. Emmanuel’s name, ironically, means “ God among us.” Who will notice if his life is snuffed out?
